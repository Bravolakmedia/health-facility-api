# About The Health Facility API Project.
This is a health facility API where a single consultation officer takes details of patients.  
 Deliverables
1. The officer can create/book, and read consultation for a patient - Only
authorized officers can create/book or read a consultation.
2. The officer can view all consultations and filter between various criteria such as date, patient
name, healthcare provider, consultation type, and medical condition, ensuring efficient
access to specific records as needed.
3. A patient can search and view his/her consultation details.
## Purpose
This is a practical test for a job recruitment exercise.

### CHALLENGES 
I did this test within the limit of my present knowledge, the user registration form is not yet submiting user registration successfully to the backend. However, console log of the "Registration hit" on the backend proved that the frontend and the backend was successfully integrated. 
I am very much open to ideas and suggestions to make the app more robust and perform its desired functionalities. This is what I am still working on.
